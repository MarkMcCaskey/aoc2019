# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions

My solutions for advent of code 2019 posted on a ~24 hour delay.

My style here is hacky, optimizing for being quick to write -- you'll see a lot of bruteforce solutions.  Feel free to read over the code, hopefully you learn something!  If you notice something I could improve, please file an issue -- I'm always interested in improving my Rust skills.
